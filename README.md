# Unreal Engine's VR Template
Your project is a copy of the VR Template from Unreal Engine 5.5. We simply added a single c++ class which turns the project into a c++ project.

For more information on how to get the project running refer to the following guide from unreal: https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-cpp-quick-start
